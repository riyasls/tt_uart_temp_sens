## what 
making uart_temperature sensor 

## Short Discription
=> This project implements a convert a pwm digital serial signal to a paralle value and trasmits it over uart(Tx) at the configured baud rate.

## How it works
The PWM signal is generated by the temperature sensor, and this module is designed to count the number of clock cycles during which the PWM signal remains LOW. The resulting count value is then transmitted to the UART receiver via the UART TX pin using the 115200 baud rate.

 ## Dependenices
=> This design instantiates one submodule: Uart_Temp

## How to test
The input PWM signal is provided on the input pin ui_in[0], and the UART TX output is connected to the output pin uo_out[0].
To capture the transmitted value at the UART receiver, configure your serial terminal (e.g., Tera Term, PuTTY, etc.) with the following settings:
Baud Rate: 115200,
Data Bits: 8,
Parity: None,
Stop Bits: 1,
Flow Control: None,
The design operates with a clock frequency of 50 MHz.The values that shown on the serial terminal is in the Hexadecimal form. The low time period = ( 1/clock frequency ) * (counter value shown in the serial terminal in decimal).
